*snes9x-1.52 (13 Jan 2010)

  13 Jan 2010; Michał Ziąbkowski <mziab@o2.pl> +snes9x-1.52.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  Initial ebuild for the cli port, without the old cruft present in the
  portage ebuild. The gtk port will probably stay a separate package, since
  integrating both ports isn't worth the increased ebuild complexity.
