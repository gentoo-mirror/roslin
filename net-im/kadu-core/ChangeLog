  Seems to work just fine, so I'm adding the keywords back.

  12 Mar 2008; Michał Ziąbkowski <mziab@o2.pl> kadu-core-0.6.0-r1.ebuild:
  Actually, I think it's better to bump libgadu and use it. Uncommented some
  code. Added a blocker for <net-libs/libgadu-1.8.0. Masked the new ebuild
  just in case.

  12 Mar 2008; Michał Ziąbkowski <mziab@o2.pl> +kadu-core-0.6.0-r1.ebuild:
  Add blocker for libgadu due to some file collisions
